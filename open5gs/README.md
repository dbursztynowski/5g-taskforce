# Installation of Open5GS and UERANSIM

This document describes how to install Open5GS 5G core network and UERANSIM RAN emulator using Helm charts form Gradiant. Reference page can be accessed [here](https://gradiant.github.io/5g-charts/open5gs-ueransim-gnb.html), but we make several adaptations to enable the platform run on Raspberry Pi.
